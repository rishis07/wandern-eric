# 0006 — Support (free cheer + Buy Me a Coffee)

**Status:** approved
**Date:** 2026-07-05 (last revised 2026-07-06)

> **Revision note:** the design changed significantly during implementation.
> The original interview-drafted version had a country dropdown
> (anonymous/share-country choice) and a public top-5-countries-this-month
> leaderboard. Both were dropped mid-build in favor of automatic server-side
> IP geolocation (never shown publicly) and a much simpler monthly counter,
> and a Buy Me a Coffee link was added as the primary CTA. This revision
> reflects what was actually built. **Everything below is live in production.**

## Components affected
- [x] Frontend            (wandern-eric/) — done
- [x] Backend logic       (python-backend/) — `update_cheer_aggregations()`, hooked into the existing hourly `run_intraday()`
- [x] GCS data schema     (new files: `cheers/<YYYY-MM>.json`, `cheers_aggregations.json`)
- [x] Production server   (RasPi) — python-backend changed, needs the ⚠️ manual upload (see Deployment steps)
- [x] **New component (not in template checklist):** a small public Python Cloud Function (`POST /cheer`), the project's first writable backend surface — deployed and live, `cheer-function/`

## Why
Give viewers of the wandern-eric dashboard two ways to show support: a free,
no-signup "cheer" (an engagement signal / content beat for Eric's YouTube
channel), and a paid Buy Me a Coffee link (one-time or membership) that
actually helps cover the Raspberry Pi and domain costs. The paid option is
the **primary** call to action in the UI; the free cheer is secondary
("or, cheer for free").

Both sides carry the same pitch, in first person: "I'll walk 100 extra steps
for you" (free) / "I'll walk 1,000 extra steps for you" (coffee) — a playful
pledge tied to the dashboard's actual subject (step tracking), and a natural
hook for LinkedIn content.

## Contract
- **Endpoint:** Python HTTP Cloud Function, `POST /cheer`, **no request
  body** — the client never selects or sends a country.
  - Response: `200 {"ok": true}` on success.
  - The function geolocates the request IP server-side (ipapi.co) to a
    country code for internal bookkeeping, then **discards the raw IP
    immediately** — only the country code is persisted. Deliberate
    privacy/legal choice: raw IPs are personal data under GDPR and would need
    a consent flow and retention policy; a bare country code isn't.
  - CORS: allow `POST` from `https://wandern-eric.de`,
    `https://wandern-eric.github.io`, `https://rishis07.github.io`,
    `http://localhost:5173` (same origins as the bucket's `cors.json`, but
    that file itself is unchanged — it only governs GET on the bucket).
- **Cheer log**, in the existing public `wandern-eric-data` bucket, one file
  per calendar month: `cheers/<YYYY-MM>.json` (e.g. `cheers/2026-07.json`) —
  append-only array of
  `{"timestamp": "<ISO8601>", "country": "<code>|null", "source": "organic"}`
  (`country: null` if geolocation fails). Per-month files (rather than one
  ever-growing log) so both the Cloud Function's append and the monthly
  count only ever touch one small file. Written only by the Cloud Function's
  service account, IAM-scoped to the `cheers/` prefix only (not the whole
  bucket). `source` exists for future extensibility — count logic (below)
  reads `len()` of the file regardless of `source` value, so it's
  forward-compatible with anything that appends differently-sourced entries
  to this file later.
- **`cheers_aggregations.json`** — `{"month": "YYYY-MM", "count": <int>}`.
  **Not** computed by the Cloud Function — instead, `python-backend/main.py`'s
  `update_cheer_aggregations()` reads the current month's `cheers/<YYYY-MM>.json`,
  counts entries (`len()`, no timestamp filtering needed since the file is
  already scoped to that month), and publishes the result. Hooked into the
  existing hourly `run_intraday()` cron, so the frontend's count is
  refreshed roughly hourly, not instantly on every cheer.
- **Concurrency:** the Cloud Function is deployed with
  `--max-instances=1 --concurrency=1` (see `cheer-function/README.md`), which
  serializes every invocation globally so no two requests ever run at once.
  `_append_cheer` additionally keeps a generation-match read-append-write
  retry loop as defense-in-depth, in case those deploy flags are ever
  dropped in a future redeploy.
- **Buy Me a Coffee:** a plain outbound link to
  `https://buymeacoffee.com/wanderneric` (`lib/config.js` →
  `BUY_ME_A_COFFEE_URL`) — no BMC JS widget (avoids a third-party script), no
  backend involvement.

## In scope
- Cloud Function: geolocate + append to `cheers/<YYYY-MM>.json`.
- `python-backend`: `update_cheer_aggregations()`, run hourly via `run_intraday()`.
- New GCS objects (above), public-read (matches existing bucket ACL); the
  cheer log's write access is restricted to the Cloud Function's service
  account, scoped to the `cheers/` prefix.
- Frontend (done) — `components/Cheer.jsx`, rendered as a standalone
  `#support` section near the bottom of `App.jsx` (before `Changelog`), plus
  a small "👏 Support" button next to the "Wandern Eric" h1 that
  smooth-scrolls to it (doesn't violate the specs/0005 "nothing above the
  heatmap except the alert" rule — it's inline with the header, not a new
  row):
  - Buy Me a Coffee button (primary) with the "I'll walk 1,000 extra steps
    for you ☕ — plus it helps cover the Raspberry Pi and domain..." copy.
  - A single free "👏 Support" button (secondary) with "I'll walk 100 extra
    steps for you 👏" copy, next to the current month's count ("X people
    supported this month").
  - Per-browser softening via `localStorage`: after cheering once, the
    button is replaced with "Thanks for the support! 🎉" (not a security
    control — just avoids the "why did my click do nothing new" confusion).
    Clearing storage resets it.
- CORS configuration for the Cloud Function.

## Out of scope
- Country/geographic display of any kind — the Cloud Function collects a
  country code, but it is **not shown anywhere on the dashboard**. No
  dropdown, no leaderboard, no manual country selection by the user.
- Rate limiting / spam / abuse prevention of any kind — explicitly deferred;
  v1 ships without it.
- Querying Buy Me a Coffee's API for real coffee counts (`GET /v1/supporters`)
  — tracked in `README.md` → Backlog, planned as a daily `python-backend`
  cron addition, not part of this spec.
- Patreon integration / "monthly contributors" display — separate, later
  spec, not started.
- Any reaction types beyond the single free cheer (no free text, no emoji
  picker, no messages).
- Historical cheer trends or charts beyond the current month's count.
- Accounts/auth of any kind.

## Acceptance criteria
- [x] Buy Me a Coffee button renders and opens `https://buymeacoffee.com/wanderneric`
      in a new tab.
- [x] Free "👏 Support" button, monthly count display, and the "Thanks!"
      softening render correctly in the frontend against the dev mock.
- [x] Clicking "👏 Support" POSTs to the function with no body;
      `cheers/<YYYY-MM>.json` gets a new `{timestamp, country}` entry —
      verified directly against the live endpoint.
- [x] The Cloud Function never persists the raw IP anywhere (verified by
      reading `main.py` — only `country` is written). Geolocation confirmed
      working end-to-end (one live test returned `null` — a cold-start
      transient, not a bug — a later one correctly returned `"DE"`).
- [x] `update_cheer_aggregations()` correctly counts the current month's
      cheer log and publishes `cheers_aggregations.json` — verified by
      running it directly against production: 3 real cheers in
      `cheers/2026-07.json` → `{"month": "2026-07", "count": 3}`.
- [ ] Two near-simultaneous cheer submissions both land in `cheers/<YYYY-MM>.json`
      (no lost writes) — deployed with `--max-instances=1 --concurrency=1` as
      specified, not yet load-tested.
- [ ] After cheering once in a browser, the button shows "Thanks for the
      support! 🎉" and re-cheering is blocked client-side until
      `localStorage` is cleared.
- [ ] `run_intraday()` on the actual Raspberry Pi cron picks up
      `update_cheer_aggregations()` and keeps `cheers_aggregations.json`
      fresh hourly in real operation (only run manually so far, not yet
      confirmed via the real Pi cron schedule).

## Deployment steps
- [x] **Frontend** — push to `main` → GitHub Actions auto-builds & deploys to
      GitHub Pages / wandern-eric.de (existing pipeline, unchanged).
- [x] **Cloud Function** — deployed, project `codineric`, region
      `europe-west10` (matches the bucket's location), gen2, Python 3.12,
      `--max-instances=1 --concurrency=1`, `--allow-unauthenticated`.
      Runtime identity: `cheer-function@codineric.iam.gserviceaccount.com`,
      IAM-conditioned to the `cheers/` prefix only in `wandern-eric-data`.
      Build identity: a separate
      `cheer-function-build@codineric.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (needed
      because the project had zero pre-existing service accounts, including
      the default Compute Engine one Cloud Build normally uses — worked
      around with an explicit `--build-service-account` rather than chasing
      the missing default). Live URL:
      `https://europe-west10-codineric.cloudfunctions.net/cheer`.
      ⚠️ Redeploy needed any time `cheer-function/main.py` changes — not
      automatic, no CI hooked up.
- [x] `CHEER_ENDPOINT` in `lib/config.js` set to the live URL above.
      **Deliberately kept the `import.meta.env.DEV` mock gate** in
      `lib/cheerApi.js` — without it, `npm run dev` would POST real cheers to
      production on every test click. Only production builds hit the live
      function; local dev still uses the mock.
- [ ] **Production server (RasPi)** — ⚠️ NOT automatic: `python-backend/main.py`
      changed (`update_cheer_aggregations()` + the `GCP_CHEERS_AGG_BLOB_NAME`
      constant, called from `run_intraday()`). Needs the usual manual repo
      upload to the Pi before the hourly cron picks up the new behavior in
      real operation. Tested so far only by running the function directly
      against production from a dev machine (`poetry run python -c
      "from main import update_cheer_aggregations; update_cheer_aggregations()"`)
      — confirmed it correctly published `{"month": "2026-07", "count": 3}`.
- [x] **GCS schema** — new objects only; no existing keys (`data.json`,
      `aggregations.json`) touched, so `Heatmap.jsx`/`Aggregations.jsx` need
      no changes.
- [ ] Update `Changelog.jsx` (user-facing change).

## Open questions
(none — resolved during spec discussion. Country display, BMC API queries,
and Patreon integration are deliberate *deferrals*, not open questions — see
Out of scope.)
