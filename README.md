# Wandern Eric
Wandern Eric is a front end pet project to force Eric to walk.

Hi, my name is Eric and I spend 10 to 12 hours a day sitting on my desk, Doctors might say that this is not helty but
I dont really have a reason to get up.
Wandern Eric connects my watch data with a nice UI so I can keep track of how bad my sedentary life is affecting me.

## Architecture
### Frontend
I asked twitter for ideas and I got 100 options. I asked chatGePeTo and told me to use REACT + Tailwind with vite.
It's a little of an overkill but the most basic thing I wanted was the GH heatmap which I found as a REACT lib

### Backend
Currently Python extraction. I extracted the historical data manually and transform it with Pandas.

## Future ideas
- Automate daily extraction.
- Add challenges.
